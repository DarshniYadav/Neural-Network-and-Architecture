## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in Python to classify these digits.

## Features
- Preprocessed and augmented dataset for robust training.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- Visualization of training metrics and results.
- Model evaluation using test data.

## Conclusion
The MNIST classification project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in solving image recognition tasks. By training the model on the MNIST dataset, the project achieved high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits. Additionally, the project emphasizes the importance of proper data preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation for achieving robust performance in machine learning tasks.
